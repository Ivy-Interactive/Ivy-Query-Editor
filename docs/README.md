## Documentation Standards

When creating documentation:
1. Place all docs in appropriate `docs/` subdirectories
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames
3. Include table of contents for long documents
4. Add examples where helpful
5. Keep docs up-to-date with code changes
6. Link between related documents
